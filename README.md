# Markopolo.ai-Bengali-Sentiment-Analysis-of-User-Reviews-Traditional-Models-vs.-Llama-3.1-Fine-Tuning
This project develops a sentiment analysis model to classify user reviews or posts into positive, negative, or neutral categories. It involves text preprocessing, feature engineering with TF-IDF/embeddings, and models like Logistic Regression and LSTM. The Llama 3.1 model is fine-tuned for comparison, with performance results documented.
